# ðŸ“ˆ Automated Trading Logic Using ThinkScript

## Overview

This ThinkScript program implements a multi-indicator automated trading strategy for use on the ThinkOrSwim platform (formerly TD Ameritrade, now Schwab). It combines technical analysis, risk management, and sequential logic to generate buy and sell signals based on real-time market data.

Originally developed as part of MF's financial automation work, this script reflects early systems thinking and logic design that later evolved into autonomous safety frameworks for unmanned aerial systems (UAS).

## Key Features

- **Multi-Indicator Buy Logic**  
  Combines RSI, ROC, MACD, MFI, and ADX to identify entry points under oversold and reversal conditions.

- **Automated Risk Management**  
  Includes profit targets, stop-loss thresholds, and trailing stop logic based on peak profit percentage.

- **Sequential Trade Tracking**  
  Detects entry price, monitors trade status, and dynamically adjusts trailing stop levels.

- **Sell Conditions**  
  Supports multiple exit strategies: profit target, trailing stop, technical reversal, and stop-loss breach.

## Strategic Relevance

This project demonstrates MFâ€™s early application of:
- Logic-driven automation  
- Risk modeling and signal processing  
- Modular scripting for real-time decision support

These same principles now underpin MFâ€™s work in drone cybersecurity, autonomous safety agents (ASA), and instructional design for aviation safety.
